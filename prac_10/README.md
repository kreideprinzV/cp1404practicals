## Estimates
Initially, my accuracy in estimating the time required for practical tasks was quite off. I often underestimated the complexity and time needed, which resulted in rushed submissions or incomplete tasks. However, as the course progressed, my estimates improved significantly. This improvement came from a better understanding of my own working pace and a deeper familiarity with the problems at hand. I learned the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable parts, which not only made estimating easier but also improved my overall approach to tackling complex problems.

## Code Reviews
Participating in code reviews has been a dual-learning process. When my code was reviewed, I gained insights into the nuances of coding standards and best practices. It helped me understand different approaches to the same problem and taught me to write more readable and efficient code. On the other hand, reviewing others' code exposed me to diverse coding styles and techniques, which broadened my programming skills. It taught me to critically evaluate code, focusing on maintainability and efficiency, which are crucial for real-world software development.

## Practical Tasks
If I were in charge of the subject, I would implement more collaborative projects in the curriculum. Working in teams mirrors the real-world working environment and can enhance learning through peer interaction. Additionally, I would introduce more frequent mini-assessments that focus on understanding concepts rather than just coding ability. This could ensure a more balanced approach to learning both theoretical and practical aspects of software development.

# Code Reviews

Here are two PRs where I conducted code reviews that highlight my contribution to improving code quality and team learning:

1. [Review on Data Analysis and inheritance](https://github.com/kreideprinzV/cp1404practicals/pull/1)
   - **What was good:** I manage to review codes that focuses on the implementation of inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP), several key aspects need to be considered to ensure that the inheritance is being used effectively and appropriately. 

2. [Review on Kivy interaction](https://github.com/kreideprinzV/cp1404practicals/pull/1#issue-2217025065)
   - **What I learned:** 
Conducting a code review for a project that uses Kivy, a popular Python library for developing multitouch applications, involves several specific considerations to ensure that the code is not only functional but also efficient and well-suited to the event-driven model that Kivy is built around. 
Each review was a learning opportunity not only for the recipients but also for me, as it reinforced my knowledge and helped me stay updated with best practices.
